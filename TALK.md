## Enforcement

The "enforcement process" for the most widely adopted code of conduct reads:

> Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
> reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
> complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
> is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
> obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
> Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
>
> Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the code of conduct in good
> faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
> members of the project's leadership.

The code itself threatens the self-appointed, self-righteous virtue committees 
with threats. How circular. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who will guard the guards themselves?


## Right to Criticize - Right to Free Speech?

Is the right to criticize and call the code of conduct bullshit or to call out bullshitters guaranteed in the happy la-la-land charter? 

It's a recipe for disaster to mix up serious sexual harrasment offences with petty "free speech" complaints.
