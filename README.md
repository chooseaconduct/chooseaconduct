## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) and Answers

### Q: What's the point? Where's the code? Three words?

**A**: Most code of conducts are page long political manifestos
by "social jacobin revolutionaries / warriors"
that try to enforce an utopia by self-appointed, self-righteous virtue committees 
with threats and execution 
of social exclusion (and personal destruction). 
History tells us how that ends - read up on tyranny
(and why free speech is not something to give up lightly.) 

Thus, Choose-A-Conduct offers alternative code of conducts. Or inspires you to write your own. 
Remember - Love (not fear) conquers all.
Be the change you want to see in the world. Learn to forgive. Be a mensch (or try to.) Humanitas. Virtus.
